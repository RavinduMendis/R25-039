No, a hacker cannot compromise the server through the initial insecure connection in this setup. While the first contact is on an unencrypted channel, it is designed with a specific security model that prevents a direct compromise.

The Core Security Principle

The security of the system relies on the server's secret CA private key.

    A new client connects to the insecure channel and sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) containing its public key.

    The server uses its private key to cryptographically sign the client's CSR. This signature is proof that the server trusts the client.

The server sends back the new, signed client certificate along with the public CA certificate.

All subsequent communication must use the signed client certificate to connect to the secure mTLS channel.
